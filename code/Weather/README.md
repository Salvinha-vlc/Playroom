# Weather data cleaning

This dataset is a small subset of a global historical climatology network dataset. The data represents the daily weather records for a weather station in Mexico for the whole 2010 (except September for which no data was stored). The goal of this notebook is to get a tidy dataset able that conveys information at first sight.
