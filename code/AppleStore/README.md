# Apple Store

This data contains information of over 7,000 Apple Store apps such as ID, name, size in bytes, price, number of ratings, user rating, prime genre, and so on.

A series of questions about them are brought up as an excuse to practice with Pandas. For instance:

- How many apps are there in the data source?

- What is the average rating of all apps?

- How many apps have an average rating no less than 4?

- How many genres are there in total for all the apps?

- What are the top 3 genres that have the most number of apps?

- Which genre is most likely to contain free apps?

- If a developer tries to make money by developing and selling Apple Store apps, in which genre should s/he develop the apps? (Simplifying by assuming all apps cost the same amount of time and expense to develop).
